# Render Deployment Guide for MobyComps

This guide outlines the improved deployment process for MobyComps on Render using Docker.

## What's New in This Deployment

We've made several enhancements to ensure the application works properly in production:

1. **Reliable Static Content**: Added fallback HTML that works even if JS assets fail to load
2. **Enhanced Build Process**: Created a custom build script to ensure proper asset paths
3. **Asset Path Fixing**: Added post-processing to fix any development references in the build
4. **Multiple Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented a progressive enhancement approach
5. **Extended Debug Routes**: Added developer tools for easier troubleshooting

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push the Latest Changes to GitHub

Make sure to commit and push all the following files to your GitHub repository:

- `client/index.production.html` - Custom production HTML template
- `public/index.html` - Static HTML fallback version
- `public/fallback.html` - Simple fallback page with links to debug tools
- `scripts/production-build.js` - Enhanced production build script
- `server/production.ts` - Updated server with improved static file handling
- `Dockerfile` - Updated with new build process

### 2. Create a New Web Service on Render

1. Log in to your Render dashboard
2. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: MobyComps
   - **Environment**: Docker
   - **Region**: Choose nearest to your users
   - **Branch**: main (or your preferred branch)
   - **Build Command**: (leave empty, Docker handles this)
   - **Start Command**: (leave empty, Docker handles this)

### 3. Add Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in the Render dashboard:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url
```

### 4. Deploy the Service

1. Click "Create Web Service"
2. Wait for the build and deployment to complete
3. Once deployed, Render will provide a URL for your application

### 5. Verify the Deployment

Test these URLs in order:

1. **Main Site**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/`
2. **Debug Structure**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/debug-structure`
3. **Health Check**: `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health/check`

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment doesn't work as expected:

### Check the Server Logs

1. Go to your web service on Render
2. Click "Logs" in the navigation
3. Look for any error messages

### Use the Debug Endpoints

These endpoints provide diagnostic information:

- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/health/check` - Detailed system information
- `/debug-html` - Simple HTML page to verify rendering
- `/debug-structure` - Full directory listing of the server

### Common Issues

1. **Blank Page**: Check if static files are being served by visiting `/debug-structure`
2. **Missing Assets**: Look at the `/health/check` output to see where files are located
3. **Database Errors**: Ensure your DATABASE_URL is correct in environment variables

## Next Steps

Once the application is deployed and working:

1. **Custom Domain**: Configure your custom domain in the Render dashboard
2. **SSL/TLS**: Render provides automatic SSL certificates
3. **Monitoring**: Configure Render's built-in health checks

## Updates and Maintenance

When you need to update the application:

1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Render will automatically rebuild and deploy the new version

If you need to roll back to a previous version, use the Render dashboard to deploy a previous commit.
