# Updated GitHub Instructions

We've made several critical changes to fix the blank page issue in the Docker deployment. Please update these files in your GitHub repository:

## 1. Update Dockerfile

The Dockerfile has been extensively modified to:
- Create debug output during the build process
- Use a more robust approach to build the client and server
- Generate a fallback index.html file
- Ensure the static files are copied to multiple locations for redundancy

## 2. Update server/production.ts

This file has been enhanced with:
- Improved static file serving with multiple fallback paths
- Detailed directory structure debugging
- A special `/debug-html` route for testing
- An enhanced `/health/check` endpoint with comprehensive diagnostics

## 3. Update Client Components

We've added simple placeholder versions of the `toaster` component to avoid build errors.

After pushing these changes to GitHub, try deploying again, and check the following URLs on your deployed site:

1. First try `/debug-html` to see if basic HTML rendering works
2. Then check `/health/check` to see the file system details
3. Finally, check the main page again

If the main page is still blank, check the detailed information from `/health/check` to see where the static files are located and if the index.html file exists.
